* game.h: Marking functions now return a value

* game.c: Return LOSER and WINNER from marking functions as appropriate

* cli.c: Test for and return LOSER and WINNER return codes

* jmines.c: Check and use return value of game_loop ()

Game loop properly terminates if a MINE is uncovered (lose the game) or all
mines have been correctly flagged (win the game). uncover_cell returns LOSER if
a MINE is uncovered. flag_cell returns WINNER if all mines have been correctly
flagged.

* game.c: Do not allow player to mark an uncovered cell

mark_cell() automatically returns success when attempting to mark an uncovered
cell.
